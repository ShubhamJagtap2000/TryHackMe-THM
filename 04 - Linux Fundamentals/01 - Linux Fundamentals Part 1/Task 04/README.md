# Task 4 - Running your first few commands

- The `"Terminal"` is purely text-based and is intimidating at first. 

- However, if we break down some of the commands, after some time, you quickly become familiar with using the terminal!

- Let's get started with two of the first commands which I have broken down in the table below:

| **Command** |	**Description** |
| --- | --- |
| echo | Output any text that we provide |
| whoami | Find out what user we're currently logged in as! |


# Answer the questions below

1. If we wanted to output the text "TryHackMe", what would our command be? 
```
echo TryHackMe
```

2. What is the username of who you're logged in as on your deployed Linux machine?
```
tryhackme
```
