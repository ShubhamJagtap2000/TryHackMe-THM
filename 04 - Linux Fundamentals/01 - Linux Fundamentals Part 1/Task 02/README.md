# Task 2 - Background

## Where is Linux used?

- It's fair to say that Linux is a lot more intimidating to approach than Operating System's (OSs) such as Windows. 
- Both variants have their own advantages and disadvantages. 
- For example, Linux is considerably much more lightweight and you'd be surprised to know that there's a good chance you've used Linux in some form or another every day! 

- Linux powers things such as:

    - Websites that you visit
    - Car entertainment/control panels
    - Point of Sale (PoS) systems such as checkout tills and registers in shops
    - Critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers or industrial sensors

## Flavours of Linux

- The name `"Linux"` is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on `UNIX (another operating system)`. 

- Thanks to UNIX being open-source, variants of Linux comes in all shapes and sizes - suited best for what the system is being used for.

- For example, Ubuntu & Debian are some of the more commonplace distributions of Linux because it is so extensible. I.e. you can run Ubuntu as a server (such as websites & web applications) or as a fully-fledged desktop. 

- `Ubuntu` Server can run on systems with only `512MB` of RAM
