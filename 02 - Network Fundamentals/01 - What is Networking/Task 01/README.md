# Task 1 - What is Networking?

Networks are simply things connected. 

For example, your friendship circle: You are all connected because of similar interests, hobbies, skills and sorts.

- `Networks` can be found in all walks of life:

    - A city's public transportation system
    - Infrastructure such as the national power grid for electricity
    - Meeting and greeting your neighbours
     
    - Postal systems for sending letters and parcels

But more specifically, in computing, networking is the same idea, just dispersed to technological devices. 

Take your phone as an example; the reason that you have it is to access things. 

We'll cover how these devices communicate with each other and the rules that follow.

In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. 

These devices include everything from your laptop and phone to security cameras, traffic lights and even farming!

- Networks are integrated into our everyday life. 

- Be it gathering data for the weather, delivering electricity to homes or even determining who has the right of way at a road. 

- Because networks are so embedded in the modern-day, `networking` is an essential concept to grasp in cybersecurity.

Take the diagram below as an example, Alice, Bob and Jim have formed their network! We'll come onto this a bit later on.
