# Task 3 - HTTP Methods

`HTTP` methods are a way for the client to show their intended action when making an HTTP request. 

There are a lot of HTTP methods but we'll cover the most common ones, although mostly you'll deal with the `GET` and `POST` method.

#### 1. GET Request

This is used for getting information from a web server.

#### 2. POST Request

This is used for submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records

#### 3. PUT Request

This is used for submitting data to a web server to update information

#### 4. DELETE Request

This is used for deleting information/records from a web server.
