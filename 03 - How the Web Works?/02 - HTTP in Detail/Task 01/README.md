# Task 1 - What is HTTP(S)

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that specifies how a web browser and a web server communicate. 

- HTTP is what's used whenever you view a website, developed by `Tim Berners-Lee` and his team between `1989-1991`. 
 
- HTTP is the set of rules used for communicating with web servers for the transmitting of webpage data, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc. 

- `HTTPS` is the secure version of HTTP. 
- HTTPS data is encrypted so it not only stops people from seeing the data you are receiving and sending, but it also gives you assurances that you're talking to the correct web server and not something impersonating it.
