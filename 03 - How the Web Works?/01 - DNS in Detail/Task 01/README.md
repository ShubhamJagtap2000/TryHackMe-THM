# Task 1 - What is DNS?

`DNS (Domain Name System)` provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers. 

Much like every house has a unique address for sending mail directly to it, every computer on the internet has its own unique address to communicate with it called an IP address. 

An IP address looks like the following **104.26.10.229**, **4** sets of digits ranging from **0 - 255** separated by a period. 

When you want to visit a website, it's not exactly convenient to remember this complicated set of numbers, and that's where DNS can help. 

So instead of remembering **104.26.10.229**, you can remember `tryhackme.com` instead.
